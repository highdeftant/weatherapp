Started learning Rust - decided to make one of my first projects a high density based weather dashboard complete with local WMATA train times, and whatever else I want to add in.

Initially built to learn reqwest and json iteration, turned into much more with features continously being added.

WIP:
- Add chart for hourly data
- Add crypto charts, or portfolio PnL
- Add "high/low" system
- Need to implement auto-updates every x seconds
- OPM status only needed during Winter, what will take its place?
